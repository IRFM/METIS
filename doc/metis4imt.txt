METIS is a whole device/shot fast simulator (0D & 1D).
METIS is a Matlab code.
METIS has been coupled to the UAL and can be called from Kepler using the Matlab actor.

The documentation of the standelone  version of METIS can be find here: 
      - .../trunk/zerod/Howto_METIS_final.pdf  
      - .../trunk/zerod/METIS_HELP.pdf

The interface between METIS an the UAL is metis4itm.m (more information, typing under matlab: help metis4itm)

In Kepler, METIS is call by the matlab actor. An example of Kepler workflow using METIS can be found here:
      - .../trunk/zerod/workflows_kepler
 

Installation:

   - put the matlab executable in your PATH (Already configured on Gateway, nothing to do)
   - The arch.inc file contains all the informations for compiling METIS. Some arch.inc
     examples can be found in architecture directory. It is parameterized for the ITM Gateway, so no need to change it.
   - type (under trunk) :
      make clean
      make (or make all)
      make testmetis (for testing if the installation is correct)
      The test output is saved in a file named log
 
Execution of standelone version of METIS
   - put the metis directory in your PATH
   - type metis
