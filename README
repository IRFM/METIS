METIS is a software program developed by the Commissariat à l'énergie 
atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA). It is a simplified
integrated modelling transport code for rapid simulation of tokamak
experiments. Its main domains of application are the preparation and
the analysis of tokamak experiments.

METIS is written in Matlab.

METIS features a graphical interface for configuring the code, running
the simulation, visualizing results, savinge results to a file 
and loading input or results from a file.

The documentation for METIS code is located in the directory “doc” under 
the root installation directory of METIS.  
The main documents are:

     1/ the reference publication: Artaud_2018_Nucl._Fusion_58_105001.pdf

METIS can run out of the box, but it will be slow.
To get correct performance, we recommend compiling, 
at least C/C++ mexfile, by launching, from Matlab, the script:

      - for Linux:   “make_metis_linux”

      - for Windows: “make_metis_windows”

For a complete installation of METIS, please, follow instructions in 
“METIS installation guide.pdf” located in “doc” directory.
