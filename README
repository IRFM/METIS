METIS is a software program developed by the Commissariat à l'énergie 
atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA). It is a simplified
integrated modelling transport code for rapid simulation of tokamak
experiments. Its main domains of application are the preparation and
the analysis of tokamak experiments.

METIS is written in Matlab.

METIS features a graphical interface for configuring the code, running
the simulation, visualizing results, savinge results to a file 
and loading input or results from a file.
